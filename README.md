## Overview

This app renders a collection of emoji entries using React, mapping over a dataset to display each emoji along with its description and meaning. It demonstrates the use of mapping functions, props, and reusable components in React.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (version 6 or above)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbolan12/Mapping-Data-Components-Practice.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

bash
cd your-repo

**Install the dependencies:**

bash
npm install

**Start the development server:**

bash
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

## Usage
The application imports an emojipedia dataset containing emoji data. Each emoji entry includes an icon, name, and description. The app maps over this data to render an Entry component for each item in the dataset.

**Example**
In emojipedia.js:

javascript

const emojipedia = [
  {
    id: 1,
    emoji: "üí™",
    name: "Tense Biceps",
    meaning:
      "‚ÄúYou can do that!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel strong!‚Äù Arm with tense biceps. Also used in connection with doing sports, e.g., at the gym."
  },
  // Additional emojis...
];
export default emojipedia;


## Components
